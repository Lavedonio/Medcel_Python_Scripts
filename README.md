## MedGrupo_Web_Scrapper
Script made specially to get all approved students that studied at MedGrupo; an information widely available in their own website.

### 1. Requirements
Run the script `pip install -r requirements.txt` (use `sudo` if running on Mac or Linux).

You'll also need [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Once installed, check the **version** under `More > Help > About Google Chrome`.

### 2. Usage
